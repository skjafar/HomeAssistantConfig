You need to reload systemd to make the daemon aware of the new configuration.
$ sudo systemctl --system daemon-reload

To have Home Assistant start automatically at boot, enable the service.
$ sudo systemctl enable home-assistant@[your user]

To disable the automatic start, use this command.
$ sudo systemctl disable home-assistant@[your user]

To start Home Assistant now, use this command.
$ sudo systemctl start home-assistant@[your user]

You can also substitute the start above with stop to stop Home Assistant, restart to restart Home Assistant, and ‘status’ to see a brief status report as seen below.

$ sudo systemctl status home-assistant@[your user]

To get Home Assistant’s logging output, simple use journalctl.
$ sudo journalctl -f -u home-assistant@[your user]

Because the log can scroll quite quickly, you can select to view only the error lines:
$ sudo journalctl -f -u home-assistant@[your user] | grep -i 'error'
